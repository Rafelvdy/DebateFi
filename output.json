However, responses from users like maikudi_2019, who inquires about the timing of the TGE, indicate a desire for more information on project specifics, which can affect investment decisions. Other users express general support for the project, but lack substantive engagement or critical analysis.",

Others like Amplifi_Fi express a more pragmatic stance, saying they engage with everything but giveaways, indicating a desire for more genuine community interaction. The debate illustrates a tension between community building and the perception of opportunistic behavior from giveaway hunters.",

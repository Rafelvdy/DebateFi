The current price surge to $2740.91, along with whale withdrawals indicating reduced sell pressure, suggests a robust bullish trend.

One participant noted, “Whale withdrawals hint at reduced sell pressure,” indicating confidence in continued upward momentum. Conversely, skeptics may argue about the sustainability of this rally, citing potential market corrections or external economic factors that could impact price stability. However, the prevailing sentiment leans towards optimism, particularly with the options market reflecting increased demand for bullish positions.\n\nETH 85/100\n\nLikes: 150, Retweets: 75, Replies: 20\n\n[Link to the original tweet](https://twitter.com/example)\n\nTime: 2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
